# Playing around with D3.js

[D3.js](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) is an extremely powerful visualization library,
GitHub is using it for all these sexy plots as well.

**Examples:**
 - [small-routes.php](https://github.com/Runalyze/runalyze-playground/tree/master/feature/d3js/small-routes.php)
  - `feature/d3js/small-routes.php?stepsize=20&size=100&limit=20`
  - draw small graphics of your routes
 - [punchcard.php](https://github.com/Runalyze/runalyze-playground/tree/master/feature/d3js/punchcard.php)
  - `feature/d3js/punchcard.php`
