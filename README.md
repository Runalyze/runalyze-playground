# Playground for Runalyze
Do you have any new ideas for [Runalyze](https://github.com/Runalyze/Runalyze) features?
A new tool or statistic? Some useful queries, nice plots or new UI components? Just give them a try. You can add whatever you want within a new directory and play around - without having to care for clean code and performance.
